# Robotic-Arm-Controller

Developed a Robotic Arm Controller in VHDL code to position a robotic arm in two dimensions by implementing an extender and grappler. 
Programmed the FPGA chip and tested the RAC circuit by applying various target coordinates and error conditions, thereby arriving at the right output results. 
This project was done as part of the ECE 124 course at the University of Waterloo.

The ECE-124 Lab4 Report is attached in the repository for a detailed expanation of our project code.
